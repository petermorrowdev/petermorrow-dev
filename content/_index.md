# Hello!

## My name is Peter Morrow.

I'm a husband, girl dad, and data engineer living in California.

I've worked in analytics, machine learning, and data platforms at several
startups and tech companies over the years. Lately I've been investing more
time open source projects.

I'll be writing more about what I'm building soon.

*Stay tuned . . .*
