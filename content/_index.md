# Hello!

## My name is Peter Morrow.

I'm a husband, girl dad, and data engineer living in California.

I've worked in analytics, machine learning, and data platforms at a few
startups over the years. Lately I've been investing more time open source
projects.

I'll be writing more about what I'm building soon.

*Stay tuned . . .*
